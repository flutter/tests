> This repository is a testing suite that contains references to tests (in the `registry` directory) that are run with every commit to Flutter
> to verify that no breaking changes have been introduced (in the "customer_testing" shards). Your merged PR is _not_ automatically run in the
> Flutter CI tree.
>
> Once merged, a PR must be sent updating `dev/customer_testing/tests.version` with the latest SHA.
